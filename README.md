#### Description:

This is a Seller Management Systeme that contains many features that allow the seller track his revenue and expenses And register his products with the price and the margin, and register all of this information in a database that  Allow to Create Read Update Delete all the information to manage his selling and expense.

# Project Features

* in this project we create a class that deals with all the thing necessary to make a CRUD application (Create, Read, Update and Delete), 

we use a few libraries in this project that help facilities and not reinventing the Wheel in a manner of speaking like:
- `sqlite3` Allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
- `datetime` That helps get the date and time in any format we want and also make it easy to handle the manipulation in time or date.
- `panda` That helps transform a SQL query to a CSV file in more efficient an easy way. 
- `getpass` A library that helps to hide the password when the user want to login or sginup.
- `werkzeug` A library that helps encrypt the password.
- `jinja2` that helpe create html pages and `weasyprint` To convert that html page into a pdf file.
- `tabulate` that print tables 

This class initially creates a database in a cyclist and have a method to connect to that database and to execute query, 
We create all the table necessary for this project using SQL query for example:
```
''' CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users(
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            username VARCHAR NOT NULL, 
            password VARCHAR NOT NULL,
            type_user VARCHAR) '''
```
this query creates a table for the users, with that every user has an id, username, password and the type of user

## Products

After adding some products you can see them in a form of a table in a terminal window like this.

![Products](/screenshots/1.png) 

## bill

adding a bill is very easy all you have to to is enter the client name and the product he buys and the amount of that product and after that the class print the bill in the form of 2 tables in the terminal window like this
![bill](/screenshots/2.png)

## expences

any selling management system must have a way to enter the income and the expenses and like the bill when you enter the expenses you can see it in a form of table in the terminal window like this 
![expences](/screenshots/3.png)

## total 
after adding an expense or a bill the program calculates automatically the total expenses and the total income and the total differences and the total number of products and of course print them in a form of a table like this 
![total](/screenshots/4.png)

## save your daily report as a csv file
you can save 3 CSV files of the income and expenses and the total of any day and every day registered in the database

## save the last bill to a pdf file
you can also save the last bill to a pdf file like this
